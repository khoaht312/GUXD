## **Conduct UX Research and Test Early Concepts**

**Research in the test phase**:
- When a product is ready to launch, it can be interated upon (Conducting research, in the form of user testing, to determine how users view and use the product).

**Benefits of test phase research**:
- Research should happen during each design phase.
- Once the design is transitioned into a prototype, user testing should occur.
- Prototype testing can help refine ideas and design, prior to finalizing the user interface.
- The UX design team can iterate the designs based on user feedback, which will ultimately lead to a better end-user experience once the product is launched.

**Types of test phase research**:
- **User acceptance testing (UAT)**: UAT determines if the product does what it was designed to do.

- **Quality assurance testing (QA)**: Examines the product for any unwanted errors and tests if everything works as intended. If, during QA testing, the UX design team discovers something that doesn't work as intended, such as a button that does not redirect to the correct page.

- **Accessibility Evaluation**: Accessibility evaluation ensures that all aspects of the product adhere to the accessibility standards. This evaluation may be part of the QA testing.

**Research structure at the test phase**:
- **Test participants**: UX designers should gather participants from the demographic that was defined as the target users.

- **Test Location**: UX designers can conduct the testing online and record the user actions for further review.

- **Questionaires**: In the questionaire, the test subjects may be asked to do specific tasks in the product.

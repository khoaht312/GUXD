-Def: **UX Design** is the process of creating products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences.
- Principles:
  - [x] **User-centered design**: Understanding the target users' needs, motivations, and behaviors.
  - [x] **Usability**: Easy to learn, use and navigate, even for first-time users.
  - [x] **Information Architecture**: How information is organized and presented.
  - [x] **Visual Hierarchy**: How visual elements like size, color, and contrast guide the user's eye and emphasizes the most important information.
  - [x] **Accessibility**: Can be easily used by everyone, regardless of ability (Visual impairments, motor limitations, and cognitive differences).
 
**Websites**: Digital storefronts for individuals, groups, and businesses and organizations.
- Common UX problems:
  - [x] Example 1: Local Bakery's website. Hunting for "hidden" menus or struggling with a confusing checkout process that requires them to create an account before placing an order.
  - [x] Example 2: News websites can often include confusing navigation and an unclear user flow. Articles would be categorized clearly, headlines would be informative and scannable.

**Mobile Apps**: Navigate the world (Order food, manage their finances, and connect).
- Common UX problems: Complex onboarding processes, unclear icons, lack of responsiveness on difference devices, and intrusive ads.
-  - [x] Example 1: Fitness app. Quickly find workout routines tailored to their fitness level, with clear instructions and even video demonstrations.
   - [x] Example 2: A ride-hailing app. Clearly display the estimated wait time and fare, show the driver's location on a map in real-time, and offer multiple payment options for a smooth and convenient user experience.

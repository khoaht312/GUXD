# Fundamentals of UI/UX Design
> explore the core concepts that make up user experience design (UXD) and human-centered design (HCD). Youâ€™ll also be introduced to design thinking, a methodology for solving user problems and how it is used in UX/UI design. Finally, the course will cover the different UX roles and responsibilities, discuss the skills and abilities prospective employers look for, and give you a chance to start work on a portfolio of your designs and experiences.

-Def: **UX Design** is the process of creating products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences.
- Principles:
  - [x] **User-centered design**: Understanding the target users' needs, motivations, and behaviors.
  - [x] **Usability**: Easy to learn, use and navigate, even for first-time users.
  - [x] **Information Architecture**: How information is organized and presented.
  - [x] **Visual Hierarchy**: How visual elements like size, color, and contrast guide the user's eye and emphasizes the most important information.
  - [x] **Accessibility**: Can be easily used by everyone, regardless of ability (Visual impairments, motor limitations, and cognitive differences).
 
**Websites**: Digital storefronts for individuals, groups, and businesses and organizations.
- Common UX problems:
  - [x] Example 1: Local Bakery's website. Hunting for "hidden" menus or struggling with a confusing checkout process that requires them to create an account before placing an order.
  - [x] Example 2: News websites can often include confusing navigation and an unclear user flow. Articles would be categorized clearly, headlines would be informative and scannable.

**Mobile Apps**: Navigate the world (Order food, manage their finances, and connect).
- Common UX problems: Complex onboarding processes, unclear icons, lack of responsiveness on difference devices, and intrusive ads.
-  - [x] Example 1: Fitness app. Quickly find workout routines tailored to their fitness level, with clear instructions and even video demonstrations.
   - [x] Example 2: A ride-hailing app. Clearly display the estimated wait time and fare, show the driver's location on a map in real-time, and offer multiple payment options for a smooth and convenient user experience.
     
**Software Applications**: Productivity software helps people get things done efficiently.
- Common UX problems:
    - [x] Example 1: Video editing software. Important tools would be easily accessible, including things like intutive drag-and-drop functionality, clear labeling, and readily available tutorials.
    - [x] Project management software. Such a platform would allow users to create tasks, assign deadlines, track progress visually, and communicate seamlessly within the project. Users could also customize dashboards to see the most relevant information at a glance, maximizing their efficiency and keeping projects organized.

**Human-Centered Design (HCD):**
1. Empathize: The design team understands users' needs, motivations, and pain points through interviews, observations, and empathy mapping.

2. Define: The team defines the problem to solve, creating a problem statement based on insights from the empathize step to identify key user needs and challenges.

3. Ideate: The team brainstorms to generate various solutions, using sketches, wireframes, and diagrams to explore ideas and concepts.

4. Prototype: The team creates tangible representations of design ideas, from low-fidelity sketches to high-fidelity interactive mockups.

5. Test: The team gathers feedback and validates design concepts through usability testing, user interviews, and other evaluation methods.

6. Iterate: Designers refine and adjust the design based on feedback, continuing until the design effectively addresses user needs and achieves the desired outcomes.
